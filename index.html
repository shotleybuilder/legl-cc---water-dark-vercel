    <h2>🌍 European H&S Law</h2>
    <p>We are currently in the process of supporting EHS law for the following countries/entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li property="country" mv-multiple>
        ...
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>💡 Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0</h2>
    <p>All the content is provided under a creative commons CC BY-SA 4.0 license. This means you can use the data
      commercially and make derivative works. Just share alike!</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>📄 Sync & Download</h2>
    <p>The European EHS law is contained inside a number of separate Airtable databases ("Bases") An Index Base, and a
      separate
      Base for each country and entity.</p>
    <p>The records of the Bases are accessible using Airtable shared views. The Index Base provides the links to all of
      the
      shared views.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>🔊 Translation</h2>
    <p>Translations to English either use the official English language published version of the law, a user provided
      translation, or the Google translate engine.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>🎓 Sorting Algorithm</h2>
    <p>Airtable has many functions for organising records. Whilst these are convenient it is important that the Base can
      revert
      to the original published order of the legislation records. We've created a simple index that works with
      Airtable's sort
      to achieve this. More information is available here.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>✔ Custom Classes</h2>
    <p>We've built two taxonomies / classification schemes applied across all the
      data sets. These make it easy to group, filter and sort the legislation to answer simple questions such as "what
      duties does
      an employer have?" More information on these schemas is available here.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>📦 Packages</h2>
    <p>Sets of legislation are bundled-up into a single share view which we call a Package. A Package acts like a coarse
      filter
      meaning users don't have to sync with or download more laws than they need to.</p>
